🚀 Customer Support Agent Simulator
Retrieval-Augmented AI Support Agent with Sentiment Analysis, Escalation Logic & Multi-Turn Memory

This project is a production-ready GenAI-powered customer support system that uses:

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

LangChain

FAISS vector search

FastAPI backend

Redis conversation memory

Sentiment analysis (Transformers)

Escalation triggers

React (Vite) frontend

It simulates a real-world AI support agent capable of answering customer queries using uploaded PDFs, FAQs, and manuals — with human-like empathy and safe fallback behaviors.

⭐ Features
🔍 RAG-Based Question Answering

Uses FAISS + OpenAI embeddings + LangChain retrieval pipeline to fetch relevant chunks from manuals, FAQs, resumes, etc.

🧠 Multi-Turn Memory (Redis)

Every user session maintains context across messages to enable coherent conversation.
